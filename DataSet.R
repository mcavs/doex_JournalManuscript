# Example 1 #######################################################################################

# Call the doex package
library(doex)

# print hybrid data in Weerahandi (1995)
hybrid

# observations of the hybrid data
hybrid$data

# group labels of the hybrid data
hybrid$species

# The ggplot2 package can be used to plot the box plot of the data in Figure 1.
ggplot(hybrid, aes(x = species, y = data)) + 
  geom_boxplot() +
  ylab("Yield") +
  xlab("Corn Species")

# Look at the summary statistics of the data before using the tests.
# Use psych package to obtain the descriptive statistics of the hybrid data
library(psych)

# Describe the hybrid data by species using describe.by(.) function
describe.by(hybrid$data, hybrid$species)

# It is seen that the variances of the species are unequal
# Thus we need to use the tests for equality of the group means under unequal variances
#
# Examples of the use of the AF and GF tests on the hybrid data are given in the follows.
# The following code performs the Approximate F-test on the hybrid data.
AF(hybrid$data,hybrid$species)

# Following code performs the Generalized F-test.
GF(hybrid$data,hybrid$species)

# Dataset in Westfall and Young (1993) Resampling-Based Multiple Testing: Examples and Methods for P-Value Adjustment
# Example: Litter Weight Dose Response
# A data set analyzed by Westfall and Rom (1990) involces
# litter weights of mice born from mothers assigned to three 
# different dosage groups and a control. For the low dose
# group the dose metameter is 5, for the medium dose 
# group it is 50, and for the high dose group it is 500.

# average litter weight data
